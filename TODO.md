- rename the functions
    sass-maps-plus
      map-get-n
      map-set-n
      map-merge-n
      map-pretty-print
- move old aliases to _deprecated
- refer to other solutions
  https://css-tricks.com/snippets/sass/deep-getset-maps/
  sassymaps
  sassdash get()
- other solutions imitate lodash' approach; problem is that maps are maps, not objects, and that supplying a list as a means of retrieving nested keys is in conflict with the fact that in a map a list may also be a key
- merge forward, the descriptions from sass-list-maps

- re: the function syntax

  sassdash
    _get and _set naively using list of keys; _merge is doing something else
    https://davidkpiano.github.io/sassdash/sassdoc/index.html
  SassyMaps
    uses an arglist-based map-get; but
    maintains map-set vs map-set-deep, to avoid problem implication
